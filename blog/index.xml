      <description>Retro gamers must all know about Q*Bert an early isometric grid game. I started out trying to create the same grid effect as a background, but with a perpetual falling of the stacks. It turns out there were some little tricks I had to consider along the way.
QBerted
With an effect like this we want to reduce the amount of overdraw. If the stacks were full size we&amp;rsquo;d have to draw each stack from the top to the bottom of the screen.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I published the repo for github-of-life. It consists of a simple Typescript application and pipeline to deploy it. The code is a simple implementation of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life ref. Using simple rules to control a cellular grid to create patterns that either life forever or become extinct. Sometimes you may be left with a set of still or osciallating life forms.
I wrote it as part preparation for the pairing interview tests that we use at Trint.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been publishing a lot of example code on Github. I use the examples for reference as cheatsheet like documentation. They&amp;rsquo;re also useful foundations to build on when I&amp;rsquo;m trying out new ideas.
Whether working with Typescript, Docker, Bash, Terraform or Linux I usually try to create small repeatable Proofs of Concept that I can refer back to when working in similar areas. Doing this helps me play with the features, understand the technology to a greater depth and lets me have a simplified point of reference for future work.</description>
